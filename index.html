            Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed and
            published by miHoYo (with publishing outside mainland China
            under Cognosphere, d/b/a HoYoverse). It was released for 
            Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows in 2020, and for 
            PlayStation 5 in 2021, with an Xbox Series X/S version 
            coming in November 2024. The game features an anime-style 
            open world environment and an action-based battle system 
            using elemental magic and character-switching. A free-to-
            play game monetized through gacha game mechanics, Genshin 
            Impact is updated regularly using the games as a service 
            model.

            Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, 
            home to seven nations, each of which is tied to a different 
            element and ruled by a different god (archon). The story 
            follows the Traveler, an interstellar adventurer who, at the 
            start of the game, is separated from their twin sibling after 
            the two land in Teyvat. Thereafter, the Traveler journeys 
            across the nations of Teyvat in search of the lost sibling, 
            accompanied by their guide, Paimon. Along the way, the two 
            befriend myriad individuals, become involved in the affairs of 
            its nations, and begin to unravel the mysteries of the land.

            Its development began in 2017 and takes inspiration from a 
            variety of sources, including The Legend of Zelda: Breath of 
            the Wild, anime, Gnosticism, and an array of cultures and world 
            mythologies. Genshin Impact has received generally positive 
            reviews, with critics writing approving of its combat mechanics 
            and its immersive open world. Conversely, some criticism has been 
            directed at its simplistic endgame and its gacha-based 
            monetization model. The game has also been subjected to 
            controversy over censorship of content related to Chinese politics, 
            allegations of colorism in character design, and privacy and 
            security concerns. Across all platforms, the game is estimated to 
            have grossed nearly $3.8 billion by the end of 2022, representing 
            the highest ever first-year launch revenue for any video game.
